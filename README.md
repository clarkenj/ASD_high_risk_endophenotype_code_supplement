This repository contains the code used to process and analyse the data presented in the "Reproducible functional connectivity endophenotype confers high risk of ASD diagnosis in a subset of individuals" paper. 

## Abstract
Functional connectivity (FC) analyses of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have established robust alterations at the group level. Yet, the translation of these imaging findings into robust markers of individual risk is hampered by the extensive heterogeneity among ASD individuals. Here, we report an FC endophenotype that confers a greater than 7-fold risk increase of ASD diagnosis in the general population. By focusing on a subset of individuals with highly predictive FC alterations, we achieved a greater than 3-fold increase in risk over previous predictive models. The FC risk endophenotype was characterized by underconnectivity of transmodal brain networks and generalized to independent data. Our results demonstrate the ability of a highly targeted prediction model to meaningfully decompose part of the heterogeneity of the autism spectrum. The identified FC signature may help better delineate the multitude of etiological pathways and behavioural symptoms that challenge our understanding of the autism spectrum.

**Figure 2**. HRS is more common than genetic risk markers and confers higher risk than traditional imaging models. a) Monogenic syndromes (green rhombs) and recurrent Copy Number Variants (pink triangles) confer high risk of ASD diagnosis (vertical axis), but are rare (horizontal axis). ASD related single nucleotide polymorphisms (yellow triangles) are very common, but confer negligible risk of ASD. Current imaging based predictive models (pink circles) identify large portions of the general population with low risk of ASD. The high risk ASD signature (orange, black outline) identifies a small portion of the general population with elevated risk of ASD diagnosis, concordant with the estimated performance in the discovery data (orange plus signs). b) The Dice coefficient reflects the degree of overlap between individuals identified by a risk marker and the true ASD population. Rare genetic risk factors (green rhombs and pink triangles) with high PPV identify a small subset of ASD individuals and thus have low Dice coefficients. Common ASD related genetic variants (yellow triangles) identify large portions of the general population but with low PPV and thus also have low Dice coefficients. The HRS shows Dice coefficients that are comparable but higher than those of existing imaging models, reflecting the large increase in PPV over these models and the lower sensitivity.
